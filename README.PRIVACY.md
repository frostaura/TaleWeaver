# TaleWeaver Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Introduction

TaleWeaver is an AI-powered bedtime story application designed specifically for children. We are committed to protecting your child's privacy and ensuring a safe, secure storytelling experience for families.

## Data Collection and Use

### Personal Information
**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information about children.** Any information entered into the app (such as a child's name, age, or story preferences) stays only on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.

### Story Generation
When generating stories, we send only the following anonymous information to our AI service provider:
- General story themes and preferences (e.g., "adventure," "animals")
- Age-appropriate content guidelines
- No personal names, locations, or identifying information

This data is:
- Completely anonymized
- Not stored long-term by our AI provider
- Used only for generating age-appropriate content
- Never associated with your device or family

### Local Data Storage
All personal preferences, settings, and story history are stored locally on your device using standard app storage mechanisms. This data includes:
- Child's name and age (if provided)
- Favorite story themes
- App settings and preferences
- Previously generated stories

This information never leaves your device and can be deleted by uninstalling the app.

## Parental Consent and Control

- **Only parents can make purchases** or manage account settings
- **Children cannot submit personal information** through the app
- All sensitive actions (settings, purchases, external links) are protected by parental gates
- Parents have complete control over all app features and data

## Third-Party Services

TaleWeaver uses the following third-party services:
- **OpenAI API**: For AI story generation (anonymized prompts only)
- **ElevenLabs API**: For voice synthesis (text-to-speech only)

We do not use:
- Analytics or tracking services
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Any services that collect personal data

## Age-Appropriate Content

All stories generated by TaleWeaver are:
- Filtered for family-friendly content
- Designed for children ages 3-8
- Free from violence, inappropriate themes, or scary content
- Supervised by AI safety guidelines specifically designed for children

**Parent Supervision Recommended**: While our AI is designed to generate safe content, we recommend parents preview stories for younger children.

## COPPA and GDPR-K Compliance

TaleWeaver is designed to comply with:
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
- General Data Protection Regulation for Children (GDPR-K)
- Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) guidelines

We achieve compliance by:

## Changes to This Policy

We will notify users of any changes to this privacy policy through:

## Your Rights

As a parent or guardian, you have the right to:
